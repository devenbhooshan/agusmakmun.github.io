I found an interesting boilerplate code for quickly starting a web extension with
Vue, webpack 4, ESLint - https://github.com/Kocal/vue-web-extension
. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Kocal/vue-web-extension#requirements) to create a boilerplate code for the extension. 

This also comes with Auto Extension reloading using [webpack-extension-reloader](https://github.com/rubenspgcavalcante/webpack-extension-reloader)

I will write a blog post on how to create an overlay on the github profile page using the chrome extension.
