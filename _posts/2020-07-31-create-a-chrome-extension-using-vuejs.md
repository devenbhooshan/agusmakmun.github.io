I found an interesting boilerplate code for quickly building a web extension with
Vue, webpack 4, ESLint - [vue-web-extension](https://github.com/Kocal/vue-web-extension)
. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Kocal/vue-web-extension#requirements) to create a boilerplate code for the extension. 

This also comes with auto extension reloading on code change using [webpack-extension-reloader](https://github.com/rubenspgcavalcante/webpack-extension-reloader)

I will write a blog post on how to create an overlay on the github profile page using this boilerplate extension code.
